# desert-classifier-learning
Note: Based on Lesson 1 and 2 from fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders (https://course.fast.ai/)

This notebook will download 100's images in several different categories of deserts, then use these images to finetine a pretrained neural network (ResNet-50) to be able to correctly identify images of these types of desert, using 8 cycles.
